Some of our biggest pollution that really disturbs the environment outside of our own is runoff from farms getting into the water and it's even worse in the winter because of the salt we put on the roads and some of the other chemicals they use to melt ice, it deteriorates roads, and tires and gets into the water.",10404,2015-04-07 13:40:16.998+00,t

I'm from Arkansas and before you say anything no not everyone from Arkansas is a toothless hillbilly. I live in Bentonville so here everyone either works for Walmart or Tyson. Also, what is your school like? I'm in the eighth grade and I go to a  Junior high school. Here everyone is relatively nice and the majority of us get along fairly well. I Have one last question. What are some of your interests. I bowl and play tennis. I'm not a sports nut though. I like to play the Baritone( its basically like a mini tuba) in the school band. I do like to play some video games too. I can't wait to read your response.

The teacher Mrs. Height was really fun to talk to and learn from. Then in the second semester me and my class moved to World history and I honestly love this class too. Ms. Geskee is funny and sarcastic witch you usually don't see in a teacher around here. So those two subjects tie for my favorite. I think its really cool that your from 
China. I've never been outside the USA. Although my brother was in Mexico for 5 min. while on the way to a hunting spot in Texas. Do you have any siblings? I have Two younger brothers. One is 13 and the other is 7 (I'm 14). Write back soon. Sincerely, Lindsay",2469,2015-04-08 00:41:03.104523+00,f

That's actually perfect because my students are on spring break right now also. Some students will still complete their assignments because they are really excited about this opportunity.

It's great to hear from you, and I am truly looking forward to sharing this penpal experience with you your kids, and my kids! I did want to be paired with students in another country, but we are still super excited to be partnering with you! My school is located in a very rural part of North Carolina, and we have a very high Hispanic population, so if your students have any questions about their culture, I am positive my students wouldn't mind sharing. 

My students are currently on spring break, but they were so excited about communicating with other kids their age that some of them might go ahead and complete assignments. However, some students don't have internet access at home, so they won't have an opportunity to respond until next monday. 
After we return from break, my students will probably comment about twice a week.    

If you need anything during the course of our penpal exchange, please don't hesitate to contact me at mhardison@duplinschools.net. Looking forward to a great experience!

No problem at all! I'll let my class know! This is our first time, and so we're totally just figuring it out as we go. I had about three kids who couldn't get logged in so we're trying to work on that as well! Maybe when your kids arrive back from break we can arrange a Skype call so they can meet each other face to face - might be a fun thing to do as we work through the project. Is your class Grade 8s?

     I believe that we, being humans, have a responsibility to take care of, and protect our environment. This is because we are a part of the inhabitants, and as such we should take care of where we live. On top of that, most of the problems are caused by us so why not pick up our mess?

      About your environment, can you tell me what the surroundings are like? And by that I mean beaches, forests, rivers and the like. Places of nature that you can just go to and truly enjoy.",11228,2015-04-10 15:39:30.68+00,t

Yes, in my family, in the Philippines, girls cannot celebrate their 13th birthday for it is bad luck. As for my 18th, it is also my graduation, so if my birthday was in August, I would have to wait until I graduate High School to celebrate.

I write, draw, listen to music, all that stereotypical teenage stuff. I have few close friends because of my low level of trust, but I'm cool with everyone. I hate having problems with people because it distracts me from more important situations and objectives.Anyways, I just wanted to say ""hi"" and introduce myself. Hope to hear from you soon.

1948,640,"In Canada, the weather is usually pretty cold.  Our winters last from November to March. It usually snows a lot during winter. In fact, on some days, we don't have school because there is so much snow on the roads. Luckily, the weather here is becoming warmer, now that it is spring. I prefer sunny, and warm weather as well, and I hope the temperature gets even warmer as the seasons change. When the weather is warm enough, I like to visit my cottage up in Muskoka, where I like to swim in the lake, and go kayaking, canoeing, and paddle boating. What activities, and other things do you like to do in your spare time? Other than visiting my cottage, one thing I really love is music. I play flute, and piano, and I love musical theatre as well. I enjoy dancing, acting, and I especially love to sing in my spare time!",10735,2015-04-16 21:05:57.056349+00,f

1950,678,"Very cool!  I have spent a lot of time in Toronto, it's a great city and everyone loves the Blue Jays.

I live in Austin, Texas.  It's a very cool city, there are still some cowboys, but there are many more hipsters, musicians, and people who work in technology (like me).  I lived in NY for 5 years before moving here.

I think the San Antonio Spurs will win again this year.  I really like the Warriors - Steph Curry is really fun to watch - but I think the Spurs will win because of their experience.  Their coach (Popovich) used to coach at my college so I met him!

Where in Taiwan do you live?  I haven't been to Taiwain.  The closest I have been is Southeast Asia, around Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Cambodia.  Have you been to any of those places?

Many people ask me what it is like having a twin sister. Some things I really enjoy about having a twin is you can't call the other person ugly in an argument:) Also, you can get the other twin to try on your clothes to see what it looks like from behind. Some things that I don't like about having a twin is that it is a lot harder to have your own separate identity. We have to share a lot of the same things like clothes, and we celebrate our birthday on the same day, so we have to share presents. It is hard because people always compare us. I always try not to compare myself, because it always lowers my self-esteem, especially because my sister is better than me at certain things. But, when I constantly hear it from other people, it is hard to ignore. We always have to stand back to back to see who is taller. We try hard to have our own separate identities. For example, I cut my hair so it is shorter than my sisters hair, and she had gotten bangs last year. Even though having a twin is hard, I love my sister no matter what. 

My favourite book is ""Divergent"". Have you heard of it? There is a movie based on it, but I prefer the book way better. I live in a small town, Oakville, which is right outside one of the biggest cities in Canada, Toronto. There is not too much to do in Oakville, but I love going to Canada’s Wonderland. It is half an hour away from my house, and it has many awesome roller coasters! Do you have any favourite places to go, and favourite things to do around town?",10735,2015-04-20 21:05:53.697+00,t

2642,944,"Lynn,

Thanks for contacting me. I teach 29 fifth graders in Redwood City, California. I have never done this before and so it is all new to me. We are currently on spring break this week and will return on Monday. We will be able to go to the computer lab on Tuesday to start our first reading and response. I am hoping to have my students be able to have access to the computers at least twice each week. We do have a few IPADS in the classroom, so I could have them try and respond more if needed. I am very excited to get this opportunity to try this and I know my students are thrilled as well. Thanks and I look forward in working with you.

     Our kids have all tried to sign up to Pen Pals and some have, I believe, connected with some of your kids. Since we have so many students (120), we have also been matched up with another school. It is a bit confusing for me, but we are trying to make it work.
   I am having my students respond to the ""Environment"" lesson at the Intermediate level. Next week we will move on to the Poverty topic. Does that work for you and your students?
I can tell you that some of my kids are very excited about the prospect of having a pen pal in another country! We are ready to help your kids with their English, as well!

All the best,
Lynn",324,2015-04-30 21:39:51.674606+00,f

   Are your kids having any trouble connecting with us as pen pals? Most of my students are receiving a message from PenPals, saying ""Thank you for signing up. We will match you with a Pen Pal by April 20."" Of course, it is well after this date. I am in the process of letting the program know that we don't seem to be matched. Do let me know if your kids are waiting on mine to respond!
Thank you,

3635,943,"Hello Megi,
    Our students have a few kids who have heard from your students, and they have responded to the questions. I think some of our kids may have responded to the environmental issue questions, when your students may have already been on the ""poverty"" issue.We'll catch up!
However, many of our students have not been matched with a pen pal yet. I am letting the program know of our issues. I just wanted to alert you that we are not properly hooked up yet! I do like the topics and questions that the kids look at, and I'm hopeful that we can get the program to work. Please let me know how it's going on your end.

Take care,

I'm your new penpal Christine! Actually ‘Christine’ and ‘Iris’ is both me. I thought I didn't sign up for the first time, so I use another username, but it looks like both usernames exist. Hope you could bear with me.
I'm a 16 year old Chinese girl. I love movies, TV shows, and books. You could say I'm a fangirl, although, if I'm bold enough to say, I don't think I'm a shallow person. You mentioned in your bio that you want to tour around the world. Actually, that's my dream too. I hope I can start the journey after college. 
I studied English when I was 8, like most other Chinese students. We have English exams, and when we finish high school, we have to take part in the most important examination in our life which also contains the English part. However, I'd rather consider English as a useful, also intriguing language. Due to the love of Tolkien's literature, I hope I can learn a few more languages, like French( I am trying to remember its alphabet these days), Italian, Russian, and etc.

4058,1102,"Dear Michael Monroe,

I am a teacher, researcher and writer in Japan. I write regularly for Digital Mobile Language Learning <digitalmobilelanguagelearning.org> and featured PenPalSchools in a piece earlier this year. I also conducted a research project measuring intercultural development among Japanese learners who participated in a six-week exchange using PenPalSchools which was published in The Center for ELF Journal, 1(1). I am using it again this term with students from another university class.

I really like the upgrades which are taking place to this program. When I used it last fall, the biggest problem was the lack of participation by the American high school counterparts our class was paired with. It seems that in this latest iteration, only those who actually write at least one response are goint to be paired. This is much better. I also am happy to see that news outside of America is now being included, as that was another problem I noticed in the previous iteration. 

I have a few suggestions for the next iteration. 

1. Consider not limit the parings to a class-class pairing, but allow for a more free pairing of pen pals. In the case of Japan, class sizes are usually around 30-40. In other countries in Asia, often larger. Last fall one of my classes was paired with a much smaller class, and there ended up being two or more Japanese students paired with each foreign student. 

2. In week-six, there is a rather goofy image and an ""ask an adult"" prompt. While I understand this may be appealing to very small children, I think this may be insulting to our university participants here in Japan. In addition, the pedagogy is lost on me when the opportunity for engaging with the pen pal seems much more relevant than interviewing a native of your own country and reporting on it back to your pen pal. Perhaps the pen pals could use this opportunity to ask questions of each other? This seems a more appropriate prompt. 

3. Consider having pen pal exchanges between different English as a Lingua Franca (ELF) learners. I do not know how many international participants you have yet, but there are more ELF speakers in the world than native English speakers. If finding active U.S. participants is a problem, perhaps a shift in the direction of an international focus for this forum would better facilitate the goals of intercultural development worldwide. As an example, Japanese ELF users could be paired with ELF users in Italy. In the future I hope that the program will develop enough that this may be possible. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this, and I wish you the best with the PenPalSchools program. 

Sincerely,

Mucho gusto.  Mi nombre es Bill y soy profesor de espanol para los grados de Kinder hasta el octavo grado.  Estamos en el estado de Pennsylvania en la ciudad de State College que esta localizado en la parte central del estado.  La manera en que funciona este program es hay una lession por cada semana que en la cual los estudiantes leen, contestan unas preguntas, y escriben a sus companeros de pluma.  Todo es muy facil y los estudiantes hacen la mayor parte del trabajo.  Los profesores tienen que explicar unas cosas sobre la gramatica y el vocabulario a veces pero los videos y las cajas con las palabras y la gramatica clave ayudan a los estudiantes.  Suerte y disfruta todo.",167,2015-05-27 15:04:22.975358+00,f

4145,22,"Hi Mike-
My Monday class wasn't able to login to penpalschools last Monday because it was a national holiday. This week they logged in and found that they were being sent to the original login page where they answer a question in order to be matched up with a penal. My students created their accounts two weeks ago and should already have been matched up.  Did this happen because they did not answer the first week's question last week?

Thank you-

How are you? My name is Diana and im working with Penpal project because we want to make an english course in some of the schools from Mexico City. 
I work in a Civil Association called ""UNETE"", we install computers in schools who doesnt have funds to do it. We install  internet, computers and educational programmes for teachers, so they can use it with their students. 
We have 15 years working in this project and we still changing and trying to innovate the school spaces. 
This course is a pilot project, we invited our collaborators to sign up their children, who some of them doesnt know english but some of them do. Their ages are between 8 and 12 years old. Not all of them have joined the course, but we just want to try and see what could happen in our schools. 
 What do you think in this time about the course?

My phone is actually one of those old Nokia dinossaurs, but I hope you don't mind. Correct me if I'm wrong, but the idea that I have of South Africa is that, unlike most African countries, it's actually a well developed and multicultural country, probably because it was a British colony until very recently, if I'm not mistaken. Is English your first language? And are you a good student? By the way, I have seen Johannesburg before, in a movie and in the 2010 World Cup :). But the capital is Pretoria, I think.

4382,1223,"I don't mind at all, don't even stress. I guess its good that you don't have that habit, it gives you time to do more useful things. Okay, South Africa has a pretty hectic history as most countries do, but it is the way it is today because of that. I don't want to bore you with a history lesson but I'll quickly touch on important points: The Dutch were the first to colonise `South Africa, I think in 1652, and the British came in the early 1800s and from then it was a tug of war of who owned the colony (not sure if 'owned' is the correct term) Lots of stuff happened, then there was Apartheid. In 1994 the country became a democracy. The reason why the country is so multicultural is because we have people of European descent, Indians migrated in the late 1800s, as well as the original African people that were here in the first place. There is such a diverse group of people because of our history and thats why I love South Africa. Yes, English is very much my first language, although I can also speak a bit of Afrikaans :D Is English your first language? Yeah I'd say I do pretty well in academics, I suck at sport so I make up for it by doing well in school. Thats so great! Which movie was it? Yes the capital is Pretoria, but its a pretty boring place.. Oh and I'm mixed race - my dad is Indian and my mom is White, and my grandfather on my mother's side came here from Sicily a long time ago, where he met my grandma who is Afrikaans - so not really :) I can honestly say I really don't know much about Portugal at all except the fact that Portuguese food is the bomb so I hope you'll enlighten me. Hope to hear from you soon! Sinead x",15547,2015-07-18 05:52:35.538904+00,f
4383,1223,"Hi, Sinead! Please, feel free to share your country's History with me. I love History, so that's not boring at all for me. In fact, if you don't mind, I'll share a bit about the History of Portugal with you. Portugal is a really old nation, that also had it's good share of conflicts (as usual, specially in Europe). The Iberian Peninsula, where I live, has been in the hands of barbaric tribes (such as the Suebi, Visigoths and Lusitanians), the Roman Empire, and even the Arabs, throughout time. 
     In 711, Tarik, a Berber commander, invaded the Iberian Peninsula and quickly conquered the majority of the territory (occupied by the Visigoths, in that time), with the exception of the Asturias region, in the far north. There, the Christian forces regrew, reorganized, and started heading south and reclaiming their lost lands, in a 800 year period that is known as the Reconquista (means the Reconquest, in Portuguese). During that time, several Christian kingdoms were born: Asturias, Navarre, Aragon, Castile, León. In addition, the County of Portucale, a vassal of Kingdom of León, was created. 
     It wouldn't take long before the people of the County aspired to independence, and so it was. In 1143, after a lot of stuff that I'm not going to tell because it would take ages, Portugal was finally recongnized by the Pope as an independent kingdom, with Afonso Henriques as it's king. This guy is pretty much the most badass our History. He was our first King and conquered almost all the territory that corresponds to today's Portugal.
     Our nation's Golden Age came in the XV-XVI centuries, with the Discoveries. We were pioneers in maritime exploration, mostly because of our geographical position. Portugal created colonies all around the world: Brazil in South America; Angola, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde, São Tomé e Principe in Africa; Macau, Goa, Daman and Diu in Asia; East Timor in Oceania. We also discovered the archipelagos of Madeira and the Azores, and we estabilished the first maritime route to India, in 1500, by the navigator Vasco da Gama. In fact, the Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias was the first to cross the Cape of Good Hope, in South Africa. In fact, we named it Cape of Good Hope, such as the greatness of the deed. Oh yes, Portugal was pretty important back in the good old days. Of course, with democracy, today we don't have those colonies anymore. 
     Holy crap, I got lost in my thoughts and wrote a LOT. Sorry! No, English is not my first language, Portuguese is. I saw Johannesburg in a sci-fi movie called District 9, but it was a strange film, so it wasn't really the ideal touristic tour xD
     What exactly is Afrikaans? Oh, and by the way, it must be interesting to have such a multicultural family. I wrote so much in this message that I should probably save up something for the next letters, so bye. I hope to hear from you soon! Antonio",15587,2015-07-18 14:16:29.17822+00,f

Aw man I knew you were going to say District 9 - I can honestly say it came out when I was 10 and I literally stopped watching 5 minutes in because it was really violent.. I think? lol anyway because of that I've never had the desire to watch it. Afrikaans is a language, as well as a culture. It's derived from Dutch: ""My naam is Sinead en ek het bruin hare, hoe gaan dit met jou?"" <-- that means ""My name is Sinead and I have brown hair, how are you?"" random I know but what the hell xD It is nice to be mixed, life certainly is interesting.

Well, I started taking English classes in the third grade, I think, but a significant part of my knowledge actually comes from movies, games and stuff like that. I remember that in my first or second year of English, I was already quite advanced and the teacher was really impressed with me. It's so great that you love History! It's difficult to find people like that nowadays, at least where I live. I didn't know Vasco da Gama was a mean guy, but it's not surprising that that does not come in our History books (nobody would want to defame a national icon, I guess). You'll have to tell me about it! 
     Yeah, District 9 was a weird movie! And yes, I do like to read! I have read a lot of stuff, so I'll just mention the most recent books that passed through my hands. Right now, I'm reading the second book of the ""Game of Thrones"" series - I want to finish the collection. I'm a fan of the fantasy/adventure genre. Quite recently, I also read Jules Verne's ""Five Weeks in a Balloon"" for a school presentation, and I loved it. It was actually about an expedition through the XIX century's Africa, where three explorers attempt to cross the entire continent (in a balloon, as the title suggests), from the island of Zanzibar, in the east coast, to the west coast.

We are a day ahead of you, so it will probably be late Thursday your time by the time my kids log on. Hope all is well and it's not too terribly hot. I miss the hot summers if you can believe that! We are in the dead of winter here- not nice!!!

Cheers! Heather

4398,1223,"Literally all of my friends take history - I'd say its one of the most useful subjects to take. Tell me more about your friends and school life! We did voyages of discovery in grade 6 so I can't really remember why but for some reason I remember there being something bad about him :o Don't you find it so strange how biased history books can be? I didn't even consider that he would be portrayed in a different light in your country. How do we know what we're learning is the truth?! And I bet people in Asia will have completely different perspectives and history books to what we're learning... Mind boggling isn't it? Dude! I also read a lot - I wish I could send you a picture of my bookshelf. I have the whole series of Game of Thrones as well but I still haven't finished the first book yet, I want to finish reading it before I watch the tv show. I'm also a fan of the same genre, do you have any suggestions? I've kind of hit a dead end and don't know what to read. I did find a new series though, the first book is called Throne of Glass, its pretty cool. I can honestly say theres not enough time for me to have hobbies, school is so hectic. I start at 7:30AM everyday and finish at 8:30PM on a monday, 3 on a tuesday, 4:30 on a wednesday, 6:30 on a thursday and 3 on a friday... So I read to procrastinate, I can a finish a book in a day or two, and on the weekends I go out with my friends. I go to an all girls school so the weekend is my only opportunity to chill with my guy friends. Oh yeah you need to answer the questions from what I understand, how basic are they? xD I had to answer questions on Europe.",15547,2015-07-21 14:00:22.301054+00,f

4410,1223,"Hi, Sinead! Well, I really only spend time with my friends during school, because I usually go to the Azores for the whole summer or most of it. In fact, I am in the Azores right now, I traveled here yesterday. In case you don't know, the Azores is an archipelago that belongs to Portugal. It's a group of nine islands in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, halfway between North America and Europe. I have family here, so I try to come here every summer, and I love it. Right now, I'm in Terceira island, but I'm flying to São Jorge island this afternoon. Regarding school life, it's pretty much the usual boring routine. School starts at 8.20 in the morning and, depending on the day, it may end at 4.40 or 1.30 in the afternoon. I also have orienteering at school so, on Mondays, I only go home at 8.00 in the evening. It's the most tiring day of the week for me, or it was, since the schedule is going to change this year. My school is kind of old, so it isn't in the best shape, but as long as I can learn there, what is the problem? What else? I chose the Science/Technology path, so my classes include Biology, Geology, Physics, Chemistry, English, Philosophy, P.E and Portuguese, of course. My favorite classes are definitely Physics and Geology, but I also enjoy Biology. What about you? I'm really looking forward for 11th grade, because my school is involved in an exchanging program with other European countries, so I might have the chance to travel to Germany, Finland or even Iceland. The project is called ""Water Around Us"". Have you traveled much? I hope to hear from you soon! Antonio",15587,2015-07-23 11:50:44.560104+00,f

My school is 112 years old but it's in pretty good shape - I guess it has to be because we may such high school fees :/ We can pretty much choose any combination of subjects we want, so I chose Science (chemistry and physics); History; IT (programming etc.) and AP Maths. English, Afrikaans, LO and maths are all compulsory though. I love all my subjects equally, they're such a fitting combination for me. We also have exchange but we can do it in grade 10, some of my friends went to Germany, Australia, India and America. I've been to Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Thailand and Mauritius. I'm also going to Vietnam and China next April on History/Science tour. I like chemistry wayyyy more than physics though ! Your holiday sounds really fun, when do you go back home?

4428,1223,"Hi, Sinead! Still in school??!! When is your summer holiday? Anyways, orienteering is a really cool sport, although it's not very known. It's basically a navigation game, but we have to do it in the minimum time possible. We are given a compass and a map with several points marked on it, and we must find them using only our navigational skills. On each point, there is a sensor where we check in with a chip we take in our hands. It's an amazing activity, specially if you like being outdoors, because competition usually takes place in areas like forests, parks or mountains. This sport is particularly famous in Nordic countries, I think. It's so cool that you get to chose any combination. It's impossible to have both History and Science classes here. They're in different ""categories"", if you know what I mean. Wow, you get to travel so much in your school! What was your favorite journey? I'm going back home on the 9th of September, just before school starts. Oh, by the way, don't worry if I take too long to reply, because I travel a lot around the islands, and sometimes I don't have much time to get in the computer. I was in the island of Pico on the last three days, I only came back to São Jorge island today, on a small boat. São Jorge is like my holidays headquarters xD, where I keep all my stuff (including the computer). And no, your memory does not deceive you, Eragon is one of the volumes in the collection.

If you would like to learn in Hungarian, I write some word for you, and if you listen the google translate, you can speak well.
1. Kígyó = Snake
2. Veszély = Danger
3. Fiú = Boy

And Jonah, where do you live? In a town, or a city, or a farm? And what kind of fantasy books did you read? I red a lot, like The lords of the rings, the Hobbit, Harry Potter, Narnia. You said, that you like animals too. What kind of animals? Have you got a pet? I've got a grey, persian cat, called Tiziano. (like the Italian painter)

How are you?  I'm fine.  The snake was just a garter snake (a non venomous snake that lives all over our yard).

I like all types of animals: lions, bears, eagles; I could go on for a while, but I will just list a few. I live on a farm, and my little brother has an domestic short hair cat, Trilby( like the hat).

I'm really glad you're my pen pal, because you sound like a nice person. I find it funny that you like sports, because I'm not that sporty at all, but I do really enjoy gymnastics and swimming. I know this might sound lame, and it probably will, but I want to get to know you better so maybe you could tell me your hobbies??? I like gymnastics, writing, blogging and making collages. Anyway, I can't wait to here from you!

I am the oldest of three, with two little sisters. I love soccer, and hope to become a pro at it it and/ or become a vet.  I have 4 cats and live in Georgia, U.S. I like school. My favorite classes are ELA, Lunch (I have a HUMONGOUS appetite) art, and reading. I am very artistic and have my room full of drawings. My mom says I am pretty good at it. So, are you ready for the 5 million questions? You don't have to answer all of them, just most of the ones in all caps. If you do have time, try to get some of the ones in lower case, but again, you don't have to answer all of them. ( FYI,  It is not really 5 million questions)

-when is your b-day?

I love anything dealing with art or music. During my free time, I like to draw, listen to music, play with my dogs and spend time with family. My favorite color is purple and my favorite season is fall. 

I have some questions for you such as what is your favorite subject in school, what is your favorite food or drink? Is there anything you like to do in your free time? I would like to learn more about you. Feel free to ask me any questions you may have either about me or Chicago. I hope to hear from you soon.

Hello Ella! My name is Alli and I live in a small town in Arkansas. Where are you from? I would love to learn more about you! What are your hobbies? Do you enjoy reading or playing outside? Could you please update your bio? This would be a huge help for me to know more about you. I am an avid reader and a devoted writer. Something that I didn't list in my bio was my favorite mythical animal. My favorite mythical animal is the Fire-Breathing Pegicorn(part dragon, part pegasus, part unicorn, and all awesome. Also, it is my creation.) Another thing that I failed to list is that I am a MAJOR procrastinator.  Well, I hope you write back soon!

My name is Lucy, I'm ten years old and I'm from England. I lived in England for nine years but I live in Denmark now. My favorite hobbies are reading, playing flute and ice skating. What are your hobbies?
In our class we are doing a project on different cultures around the world, that's why we're finding pen pals. Our school is an international school so we already know people from lots of different cultures but we think it will be interesting to learn more. What is your favorite  lesson in school? My favorite lesson is music because I like playing instruments. Our school was founded by LEGO so we use LEGO for lots of our lessons. Lego was invented and made in Denmark so there is lots here but it's quite expensive. They are building a LEGO house near our school. Ii's going to be really exciting when it's done! I don't know much about it now but I know it's going to be HUGE!

You live on a farm?! I never have been on a farm. I just saw them on TV. I live in a town, (near Budapest, the capital) called Vác. I can’t catch snakes, because we haven’t got snakes, only if the banana shipment comes, and it has got some grass snakes.
And where were you on holiday? I was in London by train. The train was so noisy, but it was a good adventure. Then I was in Italy, because I like seas, and in my country there aren’t any seas, or oceans. And what was about your holiday?
When the school will starts in your country? I started school on the 1. Of September. (So I can write only sometimes, because I’ve got a lot of tests) What’re your favourite (sorry, I know, Americans called: favorite, not favourite, but I learn British English) subjects? And in America what’s the children’s second language? Because in Hungary, the first language is Hungarian (the first is the mother tongue), the second is English.
Have you ever been in Hungary? I have never been in America, but I would like to travel.
I hope, I will hear about you soon, 
Regi

6561,1323,"Hi Regi (again) as I said before I do live on a farm. I have seen deer, bald eagles(the country symbol), rabbits, and my mom has seen a coyote. In the back yard there is a huge forest that I used to run around in (there is a trail we were making but haven't worked on for a while) until I was grounded for running up and not telling where I was. I actually lived in England once( but that was around 5 years ago), and traveled to Scotland, Wales, and Ireland. I do school year-round because I'm home schooled. My favorite(it is alright to spell it both ways) subjects are art and P.E (we don't really do it but sometimes we're told to run around the house). There is no ""official"" second language in the US.  However, Latin American Spanish, French, and Vietnamese are the next 3 most common languages spoken where I live. I have never been in Hungary but it sounds nice. And thank you for listing those new words!

6996,1323,"Hi Jonah,
Just imagine I will dance waltz! In Hungary there are three schools in your life. The primary school is that school, you are in from ages 6-14 (When you are in age 6-7 you are in class 1st when you are in 7-8 you are in class 2nd, when you are in age 8-9 you are in class 3rd… etc. Until the 8th class, because you start the next year in the secondary school.). That is the first school of a Hungarian child’s life. The second is the secondary school, you are here from 14-18 years. When you are over 18, you can learn in a university.
Now, I am in class 8th, which is the last class of the primary school, and I’m 13 years old now. And when adolescents (or teenagers?) are in class 8th, they dance waltz. This is a Hungarian tradition, and I don’t know whether you know what waltz like, so I write it down. This is dance in triple time performed by a couple who as a pair turn rhythmically around and around as they progress around the dance floor. I hope you understand it. 
And you wrote, that you’re home schooled. It sounds interesting and great! Do you like it? I would like to try it once! My favourite subjects are P.E (I like sports and running) History (I like learn about my and the other countries) I like English (I don’t explain why, because it will be longer than the page :)) and Literature (I like poets, humor, and poems). In my free time I always reading fantasy, and sci-fi books or trying to sing, but I can’t sing so beautiful.
Hungarians got a game, called ‘Mit vinnél egy lakatlan szigetre? ’ --> this is the Hungarian name of the game. (What things do you bring to an uninhabited island?) You have to list 3 things.
I wrote about singing for you, so I won’t tell Hungarian words, I will tell a Hungarian poem:
A börtön ablakába sohasem süt be a Nap,
Ragyogón süt a Nap,
És szikrázik az ég,
Csak a szívem szomorú, ha rád gondolok én
Szeretlek én…
This is a Hungarian poem about a man, who is in a prison. I translate into English for you:
The prison window into the sun never shines,
The sun is shining brightly,
And sparkle in the sky,
Only my heart was sad when I think of you
I love you…
Best regards,

7258,2212,"Hi, Neil. My name is Lizzy, I'm not good with introductions. So I'm pretty sure right now you would be mad at the pen pals school site for having a pen pal in the same country as you, same here, not having one in the U.S is bad, at least when learn about each other it will be easier. Well since I'm not quite sure how much I'm suppose to write this or what about, I'll just tell you a little bit about myself. I'm fifteen and live in the Midwest, I'm currently a freshmen and it's going great so far,  considering that my grade in Physical Science is where I want it to be, sadly can't say the same for Animal Science. I'm participating in Marching Band as  a Flutist, for other activities I will try out Speech and maybe help out with Wrestling as what we call a Student Manager. After school I babysit my neighbor's kid, Issac, who loves Minecraft, Mario, and Five Nights at Freddy's(Don't ask, I  take no responsibility of how he got there). For other personal stuff about me,  I love watching YouTube it's a great place to find lots of people there that can cheer you up. I'm friendless on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Why? I don't have any accounts on them, sad but true. I love animals, I can play chess, and love listening to music, despite it gets me in trouble sometimes. Before I finish, I like to know some questions about you, let's see...
What are you liked and dislikes?
How's school treating you Middle or High?
What career do you want after graduation?
What do you like to do during your free time? 
That's all I can think of right now, so guess This goodbye and hope to hear from you soon!",17326,2015-09-04 19:54:26.896833+00,f

Do you like it? It is a classic poem. I read that you like singing. I don't really like to, but I know a few good tunes. I am learning violin and may learn Martial Arts. In the game you told me about, the three things that I would bring are a good pocket knife, plenty of rope, and assuming I was stuck there forever, I would bring another person to talk to so I wouldn't go insane (and for some help here and there).
I think it is awesome that you are learning to waltz, I did actually  know how to do it, but thank you for describing how to. I am in sixth grade but I am 12; schools are kind of different here. Kids also go to school until 18 or so here. What do you do after school for fun? I usually play with my friend (I only have one) or my brothers and sister.

I was thrilled when I knew you'll be my penpal. I want to know the new friends and I'm so happy you are my first one:-)

I'm a 9th grade student from Taiwan. Time don't wait for people, I can't believe Im going to  graduate next year. Before I graduate I will have an important exam. I got a little nervous because I don't know what kind of study type is perfect to me. During this year, I think I can find it out. Good me luck.

How was your summer? I think it must be as wonderful as mine! Unfortunately, it's over now:-( I wrote a list before the school start. It's about the things I want to after I gradute. ""Have new friends"" is one of my golds. I decide to achieve it first cause' I'm not that kind of person can talk to everyone easily. My talking skill is suck. I hope I'm brave enough to achieve this.

But, around 5-10 minutes from us are lakes and it is a big tourist attraction in the summer. If you live in the United States you might know it as Okoboji, Iowa. More about me is I absolutely love sports. Basketball is my favorite sport, which I have been play since kindergarten. I also play volleyball and run track. I am playing varsity volleyball this year as a freshman. I have yet to have a practice with the basketball and track team, so those I do not know yet. I would play softball, that always was my second favorite sport. But, I play on a team out of Ames, Iowa which plays in the summer. (Iowa State University is based out of Ames). It is a Nike sponsored team, one of the best in the nation. I have traveled to Chicago twice, San Francisco, and Hampton Virginia, and those are just the bigger tournaments. Also, I have a pretty big family I am the youngest of six kids. I hope to get to know you and about where you live!

I'm sure it's nice having older siblings to help along the way.
Where I live in North Carolina, it is very rural.  There are farms and lots of mini cities in the middle of nowhere.  It's hard to predict the weather here, but it's normally very hot in summer and very cold in winter.  There are also hurricanes sometimes, but they rarely reach N.C.  
Towards the coast there are famous beaches, lighthouses, and the Outer Banks around the state's shoreline.  There are also lots of shipwreck and pirate artifacts at the beaches from the colonial days, as well as battlefield sites.  There are many festivals that take place in the mountains, and many people visit in the fall to look at the leaves.
I don't know much about Iowa, but I'm looking forward to learning more!  I looked up pictures of Okoboji, and it's really pretty.  I hadn't known it existed until now.",18808,2015-09-08 16:39:42.593112+00,f

I play volleyball, basketball, softball, and I might run track this year, although I'm still unsure about that. Some of my hobbies include reading, drawing and having a family night, or hanging with friends. I live with my mom and stepdad with my two sisters in Iowa, but my dad lives in Minnesota with my stepmom , who is currently pregnant with twins, and three stepsisters. I have two dogs at my moms, and two dogs and four cows at my dad's (he lives on a farm). Anyway there's more I want to add but that basically sums it all up.

The students here don't study as hard as the students over there in Hong Kong. Some don't even have the money to study while others do. Some people get the chance to study but they don't appreciate it so they waste their time in school and get bad grades. Also, some students study hard here but not that hard. These are the students who get good grades and have the potential to a great future. The adults work but the jobs here don't have too much pressure. Some adults even work extra to provide for families but compared to Hong Kong (China), people here don't have to work that hard. I think Belize is a good country for those who want a relaxed life and those who are retired. It's a very tranquil, peaceful and wonderful country even though we do have violence every now and then but this happens mostly in Belize City.

But I am always hear that voices, that Trilby expresses, because my cat, Tiziano is an old (he is twenty) male cat, so he makes voices like a goat, or a frog. Sometimes I can't decide, that is it Tiziano's voice, or the washing machine's?
For your question, I do some sports after school, or I chat with my friends about the Scratch. Scratch is a programming language for children (and young adults) and we do a project on it. You can use scratch on https://scratch.mit.edu this is the website. Or sometimes I watch films on TV. What do you watch on TV? Or what do you prefer on TV? 
Your poem about Nantucket was very-very good, I likedit. :) When I was 10, I like an English poem, about a fish. One, two, three, four, five; Once I caught a fish alive; Six, seven, eight, nine, ten; Then I let him go again; Why did you let him go?; Because he bit my finger so; Which finger did he bite?; This little finger on my right. It was a pretty, kind poem, but I deplore the fish.... In that game, please write the things again, not about survival, about your favourite things, that things without them you can' t live. For example your favourite game, or something. I bring a minion (not the cake) the yellow figure, from the film, Despicable Me; my cat; and a shop, because I like candys :)

It is great that your students have extra time in the day devoted to writing to their penpals. I also meet my students every other day. Are you on the block schedule then? We may be rematched, because there was a glitch in the system. I got an e-mail that we are starting on Sept. 14th and the section opened last Monday. I called PenPalSchools and they will try to rematch us. I am not sure how it is going to work considering that your students are one week into the assignment.",16798,2015-09-13 16:16:44.830351+00,f

Are you satisfied with your environment including the plants and animals there?

Yes, I am. I'm satisfied with my environment including the plants and animals here because they're all special and unique here in my country. Also, the air and water's very clean and there's not much pollution and contamination in my country. Everything's also very green, nice and relaxed here. You can even go swimming here in the rivers without having to worry about pollution, unclean water and all that. Belize is also the only place that has a Jaguar Reservation in the world. It's not very developed here but I love it just the way it is. I wish it would stay like this forever. I treasure Belize the way it is because not many countries have the natural habitat and environment that haven't been touched and contaminated just for more developments that we don't really need.

9148,2631,"Hi Hellen!

So, from the looks of it, we two are penpals now ;-) 

What is your motivation for using the project? I'm just curious, because on my end, it's ultimately about english practice. English isn't my native language, and right now I'm really interested in improving it as much as possible. And sooner or later I came to the idea that having a penpal wouldn't be bad. The last time I had a penpal was in 5th or 6th grade, so, yeah, it'll be interesting to see how this whole thing will work out.

David",23234,2015-09-14 13:08:45.592668+00,f

What happened the last time?  I teach geography and world history in Oxnard, California.  I actually teach at my old high school.

They are reworking the curriculum supposedly to align with U.S. to U.S. We too were extremely disappointed. The kids were so excited to have a pen pal from another country. They took it well when I broke it to them, but I could see the disappointment. We are totally willing to keep with it and see how this works out. I think this company will be great when it grows more. I like the setup, it just needs more teachers from other countries.

Yes, I do farm. We owned 80 acres a couple years ago and we recently bought another 80. It cool that you have so many sports in your school. We don't have the opportunity to play some of those sports. We just redid the basketball gym this summer. We have a elementary and high school gym, a football field, a track around the football field, and a baseball/ softball field(they are connected). Yes, Disney World is really fun. I would love to go again someday, it was my first time on a airplane.

10147,2794,"Hello Anthony, I am actually new to using Pen Pals too. It looks like once your students are matched with someone, their assignments are posted under a different category. For example, the topic for this week is ""the environment."" I am going to have my students complete one topic per week. During that time they read articles, watch videos and respond to questions. When their pen pal does the same, they can read their responses and chat with them. I hope this was helpful.",19595,2015-09-15 16:03:17.519709+00,f

11085,2625,"Hello, Peter. I am also from the United States, and I'm curious as to how your city or town is different from mine. My town is pretty small; only about 700 students attend my high school. Despite the size, there is a lot of diversity in our community. We have many families with heritage in Central and South America, as well as the Middle East. I myself have heritage in Mexico, and speak Spanish fluently. We're surrounded by other small towns where the largest township is approximately 40 minutes away. To get around, most everyone uses a car. Otherwise, they walk or bike if it's not too far of a distance. There is no city busing system. What is your town like?",19136,2015-09-17 13:16:48.92113+00,f

    Lynn Simoneaux here, a 6th grade World Studies teacher from Dallas, Texas. I'm so very happy to meet you. 
     I read your bio and I see that you are interested in having your students work on a creative project about a global issue. This is such a coincidence! I just made up and assigned a PBL (Project-Based Learning) lesson based on 10 global issues. I found the issues listed on a website, https://www.100people.org . We divided up into groups according to the issue that most interested the student, and we are just getting started with our research. 
   Would you be interested in having our students collaborate with yours in some way? When do you plan to do your project?
I'll be happy to send you my homemade lesson plan, if you're interested!

All the best,
Lynn",324,2015-09-17 22:00:41.575607+00,f

I am just starting out with this Pen Pal program.  I am actually the Educational Director/Owner of a learning center and am using this as enrichment with some of my students.  I only have two students that are going to be using it.  Have you used this program before? I'm wondering if they partnered us since I only have two students??  or are your students my kids penpals?  That would be weird though since we are both from US.  So far my kids are paired with Eli and Justin, are they in your class?
 I'm sorry, but I'm confused about this but am eager to get started! Please let me know what you think.
Thanks,

How are you? My name is Ashley L., and I teach middle school ELA in San Antonio, Texas. I wanted to introduce myself because it seems a few of our students have been matched up as penpals. I'm curious to know what your hopes and expectations are with Penpal Schools and how you plan to utilize this learning tool for your students. I’m hoping for my kiddos to better their email writing skills of course, but to also learn about the differences and similarities they share with their penpal (culture, daily life, etc.). I hope to also get my students to learn how to develop good questions that will start a conversation and transform them into worldly thinkers. Please write back when you have a chance as I think sharing our visions will help us make this experience better for our students.
